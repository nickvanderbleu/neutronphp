This program is an experimental new PHP framework for template loading and policy and settings control. I can load administrative templates, front end templates or load template from directory in root.I has a few build in functions and featured in the core version. Language translation, page control and log and IP monitoring.
This program is meant to serve as a front end framewor to load standard web templates in .php file format. I think I have worked out all the bugs in version 0.6.0 but if you find any isues please let me know @ support@luvbytesllc.com. with subject Bug report. I will attempt to develop this platform into a viable enterprise solution but Its going to take time
and the updates may be on no particular cycle. Check this readme file for update info.
