This program is an experimental new PHP framework for template loading and policy and settings control. I can load administrative templates, front end templates or load template from directory in root.I has a few build in functions and featured in the core version. Language translation, page control and log and IP monitoring.
This program is meant to serve as a front end framewor to load standard web templates in .php file format. I think I have worked out all the bugs in version 0.6.0 but if you find any isues please let me know @ support@luvbytesllc.com. with subject Bug report. I will attempt to develop this platform into a viable enterprise solution but Its going to take time
and the updates may be on no particular cycle. Check this readme file for update info. I am releasing the beta versions under GPL v3 except for commercial or enterprise licenses which would be needed to use and modify the source code on the corporate level. so please conntact the afore mentioned support email to purchase a license, otherwise the core version is fre too use and includes one free to use admin template and one free to use site template. The Pro version of the framework is far more complex and has more functions and features but it is not at a stable version yet and will be released eventually.
